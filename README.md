>Biology runs on genes and genes are the units of meaning of heredity. A word has been invented, meme. A meme is the smallest unit of meaning of an idea. Ideas are made of memes. - Terence McKenna (1990)

# **About Me**

My fam made the move from El Salvador to the US back in the '80s, dodging the chaos of a civil war. Growing up as a first-gen Salvadorian American, I didn't really jump on the education train when I was younger. But now, I'm all about pushing my limits and stepping out of my comfort zone. There's so much knowledge out there, and I'm determined to soak it all in, using those skills for something bigger than just me.

So, by pure luck, I stumbled upon The Clubhouse, thanks to my brother-in-law who tagged along when we left New York. With this fresh start and a newfound interest in becoming a developer, The Clubhou.se felt like the perfect move. It lines up perfectly with my goals, giving me the lowdown on everything from front-end design to back-end data management. This is the kickoff of my journey into the world of web development.
